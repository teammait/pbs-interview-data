00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.061
 … I want to ask you about the end of September of this year [2022], when Russia had been pushed back, 

00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:11.352
but there were a lot of signs that Vladimir Putin, that Russia were not backing down. 

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:16.612
There were nuclear threats, mobilization, and then on Sept. 30 the announcement of annexation. 

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:17.852
 That’s right.

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:20.272
 When you’re watching that, how concerning is it? 

00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:23.320
What are you thinking at that moment at the end of September?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.336
 It’s all very concerning because what we saw at the end of September 

00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:33.088
was Vladimir Putin doubling and tripling down on the aggression with the mobilization, 

00:00:33.088 --> 00:00:39.197
with the purported annexation of Ukrainian territory, with the loose talk about nuclear weapons. 

00:00:39.197 --> 00:00:43.352
He actually chose a moment to do that when the entire world was gathered in New York 

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:45.752
at the United Nations for the General Assembly. 

00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:51.372
And, it was a further aggression not only against Ukraine, but an aggression against everything people were 

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:57.812
in New York to talk about, the United Nations Charter, the basic principles that try to keep peace and security.

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:07.856
So it was, of course, very concerning because it showed, at least at that point, that President Putin had not 

00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:14.911
taken the lessons of the experience in Ukraine, which was that the idea that he would erase its identity, 

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:22.856
its independence and subjugate Ukrainians to the will of Russia had failed and would fail.

00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:33.810
So we’re looking at this, and it’s I think evidence that, unfortunately tragically, this is likely to continue for sometime, 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.794
because Putin had not yet digested the fact that Ukraine was not going to give up on its independence 

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:46.536
and its sovereignty, and the international community was not going to give up on Ukraine.

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:50.342
 As far as the danger of this moment, somebody told us that in some ways 

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:53.568
it might have been more dangerous than the Cold War because of the unpredictability. 

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:58.692
There wasn’t a doctrine; there weren’t Soviet committees that were determining the policy. 

00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:04.472
How much is the unpredictability of Vladimir Putin, of the Russian government a danger in that moment?

00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:13.248
 Unpredictability, miscalculation, miscommunication is always something that we’re focused on and concerned about. 

00:02:13.248 --> 00:02:21.080
It’s why it’s important to be as clear as we possibly can about what we see and what we’re going to do 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.496
to make sure that, to the best of our ability at least, there isn’t miscommunication that leads to miscalculation. 

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:37.363
But these are fraught periods, and the most important thing is to be as clear as we possibly can be.

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:41.263
And by the way, that was true from the very start. 

00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:48.024
Everything that we said to the Russians in advance of the aggression as we saw it mounting that we would do, 

00:02:48.024 --> 00:02:48.960
we’ve done. 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.600
I don’t think there can be any doubt about President Biden saying what he thinks and then doing what he says.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.760
 Let me ask you one more question about that speech because it’s sort of remarkable, 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.100
the speech that he gives, because so much of it is about the West, is about the United States. 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.504
He’s invaded Ukraine, but the speech is about the West, is about the United States. 

00:03:10.504 --> 00:03:16.944
It almost seems like Vladimir Putin sees a conflict; this is a conflict between the United States and Russia. 

00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:17.684
Is that accurate? 

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:18.664
Is that how he sees it? 

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.704
Is that how you see it?

00:03:20.704 --> 00:03:24.824
 It’s not, but Putin would like to make it that way, or at least make it seem that way 

00:03:24.824 --> 00:03:33.310
because he needs to be able to further justify what he’s doing to his own people, and broadening it 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.520
into some kind of conflict with the United States, with the West, with NATO—take your pick—serves his purposes. 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.376
But this is fundamentally about one thing: It’s about his aggression against Ukraine; 

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:52.224
his efforts to erase its sovereignty, its independence; his efforts to subsume it into Russia. 

00:03:52.224 --> 00:03:56.432
That’s what he’s actually acknowledged himself, and that has failed. 

00:03:56.432 --> 00:04:04.000
And so now he needs to somehow justify what’s happening, justify the horrific sacrifices 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.080
that Russians are making on his orders by broadening the aperture, making this about something bigger.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.582
 So let’s go back to the administration coming in. 

00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:20.230
We spoke to you in 2017 after the Obama administration, and this is a new time when you are coming in. 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.570
How are you evaluating Russia, the threat from Vladimir Putin as you’re coming into the administration this time? 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.080
How are you and the president informed by what you’d experienced before and seeing how things had changed?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.302
 Well, first, when we’re coming in, remember that there is a lot going on 

00:04:37.302 --> 00:04:42.112
that’s having a profound impact on the lives of our fellow citizens, starting with COVID, 

00:04:42.112 --> 00:04:48.700
and hopefully getting ahead of COVID, starting an economic recovery to bounce back from COVID. 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:57.803
We have an existential climate crisis on our hands, and we’re trying to make sure that we can put our focus, 

00:04:57.803 --> 00:05:00.320
our efforts, our resources on dealing with that. 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:09.380
And in that sense, no one is looking for conflict, for confrontation with Russia, even as we knew well 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.220
that it can make a lot of trouble. 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.544
Many of us had experienced that as part of the Obama-Biden administration.

00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:23.776
But the first focus was on trying to determine whether we could have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia 

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:27.656
so that we could actually focus on what people want us to be focused on 

00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:34.376
and need us to be focused on in terms of making their lives a little bit better, a little bit safer, a little bit healthier.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:40.648
Very early in the administration, the president extended the new START, strategic arms control agreement, 

00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:42.896
because it was in our interest to do that. 

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:48.327
And of course we had engagements with President Putin, with Russia, 

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:53.056
including leading up to the summit that they held in Geneva. 

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:58.276
But it was really about testing a proposition, whether Russia was prepared to have a more stable, 

00:05:58.276 --> 00:06:05.070
predictable relationship so that all of us could focus our time, our efforts and resources on things 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.448
that our citizens needed us to be focused on and cared about.

00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:11.744
 Was there a debate going into that summit about whether to have it? 

00:06:11.744 --> 00:06:16.392
What was the calculation that was made in agreeing to have the president meet with Vladimir Putin?

00:06:16.392 --> 00:06:19.492
 There wasn’t a particular debate about having the summit. 

00:06:19.492 --> 00:06:27.579
We always have very vigorous discussions about all of our policies; it’s something the president looks for 

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:28.822
and expects and wants. 

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:35.160
But for the president, for the administration, this was about a couple of things:

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.320
First, there’s no substitute for face-to-face communication 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:47.544
just to make sure that there’s no ambiguity, no misunderstanding, no miscalculation as a result. 

00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:55.389
And President Biden was determined that President Putin hear from him exactly why the president says what he says, 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:02.024
why he does what he does, and what Russia could expect, depending on the direction that it took. 

00:07:02.024 --> 00:07:06.904
And this was an opportunity, an important opportunity to share directly with Putin 

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:14.040
that our preference was for a more stable, predictable relationship, but we would be prepared either way. 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.955
And if Russia chose to act aggressively, if it chose to take actions 

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:26.200
in one way or another that were dangerous and destabilizing, we’d respond. 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.984
But our preference was more stability, more predictability. 

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:36.644
And having Geneva was an opportunity to share that directly, face to face, with Vladimir Putin. 

00:07:36.644 --> 00:07:41.604
And then, as the president said, “We’ll see; we’ll know over the next six or nine months,” 

00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:46.544
he said right after the meeting with Putin, “what course Russia decides to take. 

00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:48.480
But either way we’re prepared.”

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.600
 How did that meeting go? 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.800
Because we’ve heard reports about other meetings with other presidents, like President Obama, 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.224
where he has a list of grievances and he’s sort of dismissive. 

00:07:57.224 --> 00:07:59.424
What’s the chemistry between the two of them? 

00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:00.592
What is that meeting like?

00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:03.017
 Well, I’m not sure if “chemistry” is the word I’d use, 

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:10.544
but the meeting in Geneva started with just four people: of course the two presidents; 

00:08:10.544 --> 00:08:15.656
I was there with my Russian counterpart, the foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. 

00:08:15.656 --> 00:08:25.960
And there was a very detailed, vigorous but I would say also very professional conversation 

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.904
between the two presidents. 

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:35.232
Part of it was sharing more broadly, for President Biden, his own worldview 

00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:39.477
and what we were focused on and what we wanted to do. 

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:44.699
Part of it, as I said, was sharing our preference for a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia, 

00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:49.761
but also making very clear that if Russia chose a different path, we would respond.

00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:55.080
But I think the tone of the conversation was professional. 

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.025
It was direct. 

00:08:56.025 --> 00:09:00.508
There were not a lot of polemics, not a lot of extreme arguments. 

00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:04.200
But it was very clear where we had our differences. 

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.080
President Biden made very clear where we saw things differently, and so did President Putin. 

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:21.161
And I think after that initial session of almost a couple of hours really between the two of them, 

00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:25.329
there was a broader discussion where we brought in colleagues on both sides. 

00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:33.265
But this was really setting the table for what would be a test over the coming months 

00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:40.312
about which direction Russia wanted to go in, and to make sure that President Putin heard directly 

00:09:40.312 --> 00:09:46.560
from President Biden what our preference was, but also what we’d be prepared for if Russia chose the wrong path.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.003
 But what you were hearing from President Putin in that meeting was not a clear warning 

00:09:51.003 --> 00:09:53.384
about what was going to happen within a year.

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:54.404
 No. 

00:09:54.404 --> 00:09:59.544
In fact, there was certainly no warning about Ukraine; and on the contrary, 

00:09:59.544 --> 00:10:04.404
President Biden made clear in the meeting to President Putin our commitment to Ukraine, 

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:09.124
our commitment to its sovereignty, to its independence, to its territorial integrity. 

00:10:09.124 --> 00:10:14.712
There had been prior to the meeting an initial massing of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border back in the spring. 

00:10:14.712 --> 00:10:20.584
Those forces had been pulled back, but that was something that had gotten our concern in the moment, 

00:10:20.584 --> 00:10:24.761
and it was important, as President Biden did, to make clear our commitment to Ukraine 

00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:28.892
so that, again, Putin would understand that and factor that into his thinking. 

00:10:28.892 --> 00:10:33.040
But there was certainly no warning from President Putin about what he intended to do.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.952
 It’s not the first meeting Biden has had with Putin. 

00:10:35.952 --> 00:10:37.452
There’s a famous meeting in 2011—

00:10:37.452 --> 00:10:38.232
 That’s right. 

00:10:38.232 --> 00:10:43.274
 — when he goes to Moscow, and he writes about it in his autobiography, that he says to Putin, 

00:10:43.274 --> 00:10:46.712
“You don’t have a soul,” and he says, “Now we understand each other.” 

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:51.410
Can you tell me what happened in that meeting and how it informed President Biden today, 

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.160
what he would have taken from that previous meeting that he’d had?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.272
 Well, I was there with then-Vice President Biden at the meeting just outside of Moscow 

00:11:00.272 --> 00:11:03.380
with President Putin—then, actually, Prime Minister Putin. 

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.442
In fact, in that particular moment, [Dmitri] Medvedev was the, quote/unquote, “president,” 

00:11:08.442 --> 00:11:10.387
and Putin had become prime minister. 

00:11:10.387 --> 00:11:21.556
But I think it was very useful to President Biden because he had a further appreciation of 

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:36.306
how Putin approaches these meetings, his style, his tone, the almost total lack of emotion 

00:11:36.306 --> 00:11:48.060
that he brings to these conversations, but also the importance of being able to speak directly and clearly. 

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:56.167
And yes, as you said, there was a moment when they were in Putin’s library, 

00:11:56.167 --> 00:12:02.029
and then-Vice President Biden said to him, “I’m looking in your eyes, and I can’t see your soul,” 

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:04.632
and Putin said, “Good. We understand each other.” 

00:12:04.632 --> 00:12:11.256
So it’s a good way, an important way to take stock of someone. 

00:12:11.256 --> 00:12:17.556
And I think that and other engagements that they’ve had is something 

00:12:17.556 --> 00:12:24.296
that helped inform the president’s approach to the meeting in Geneva and, for that matter, to the overall relationship.

00:12:24.296 --> 00:12:28.120
 The message he’s sending to Putin in a moment like that is what?

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.456
 The message that he’s sending is, we’re not here to kid each other. 

00:12:33.456 --> 00:12:41.744
We’re here representing our countries, representing our interests, and we need to speak clearly; 

00:12:41.744 --> 00:12:43.711
we need to speak directly. 

00:12:43.711 --> 00:12:48.666
And that’s something that President Biden values, and I think he wanted 

00:12:48.666 --> 00:12:54.016
to make sure that then-Prime Minister Putin and Vice President Biden, that they understood each other. 

00:12:54.016 --> 00:12:59.056
 What’s the first moment that you realize this is serious, that Russia 

00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:01.278
might really be contemplating an invasion? 

00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:02.560
And what’s that like?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.665
 Well, two things happened. 

00:13:03.665 --> 00:13:10.745
First, we’d seen in the spring of 2021, we’d seen this massing of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders, 

00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:13.280
but then the forces were pulled back. 

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:21.744
Then some months later, as we got into the fall, we saw forces returning to the border area. 

00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:26.415
That in and of itself was troubling and disturbing. 

00:13:26.415 --> 00:13:39.480
But on top of that, we got information that actually explained Russia’s thinking and laid out its plans. 

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.816
And it was in that moment when the combination of seeing the forces deployed and then having, 

00:13:45.816 --> 00:13:53.232
from the information we’d gotten, real visibility on what Russia was actually thinking and what they were planning, 

00:13:53.232 --> 00:14:00.752
that’s when we really saw the storm rising and heading in Ukraine’s direction. 

00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:03.776
Putting those two pieces together was critical. 

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:05.296
 That must have been an amazing moment. 

00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:11.156
Do you realize that this could be the defining foreign policy conflict of this administration? 

00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:14.528
Are the stakes that obvious that early?

00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:18.848
 I don’t think people are thinking in terms of what’s going to be a defining moment; 

00:14:18.848 --> 00:14:25.648
that will be for historians to judge and for everyone to be able to reflect on when they’re no longer in these jobs. 

00:14:25.648 --> 00:14:38.272
No, what we saw was this storm rising, heading in Ukraine’s direction, and the tremendous damage that that could do, 

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:46.252
first and foremost to Ukraine, to Ukrainians, but potentially in unleashing all sorts of forces that could 

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:56.068
lead to wider conflict, as well as being a direct aggression against the very foundation of international relations. 

00:14:56.068 --> 00:15:00.767
I mean, we talk in abstract terms about these principles established after the Second World War 

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:03.927
to try to make sure that we wouldn’t have another world war, 

00:15:03.927 --> 00:15:12.696
where there has to be a basic respect for a country’s borders, for its independence, for its sovereignty. 

00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:16.876
You can’t just go around changing another country’s borders by force or invading them. 

00:15:16.876 --> 00:15:21.112
Otherwise, if you do, and that happens with impunity, a Pandora’s box is opened, 

00:15:21.112 --> 00:15:24.176
and we’re going to have aggression and conflict around the world.

00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:29.096
So we saw these twin threats—a threat to Ukraine itself, a threat to the international system 

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:34.056
if this was allowed to go forward—and that galvanized a rather extraordinary action 

00:15:34.056 --> 00:15:39.249
on the part of the administration to bring this to the world, starting with our allies and partners, 

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:44.632
to make sure that they, too, understood what was coming, to do everything we could to prevent it, 

00:15:44.632 --> 00:15:51.208
to avert the Russian aggression, but also to make sure we were prepared if Russia went ahead nonetheless.

00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:53.581
 What’s the message that’s delivered to Vladimir Putin? 

00:15:53.581 --> 00:15:56.201
I understand there’s a video conference between the two presidents. 

00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:58.000
There’s later telephone calls. 

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.938
What was President Biden saying when he was speaking directly to Vladimir Putin in that run-up, 

00:16:02.938 --> 00:16:05.744
in that December-January time frame?

00:16:05.744 --> 00:16:08.967
 The president’s saying a few things. 

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:14.336
He’s saying, first of all, “We see what you’re doing, what you’re planning, what you’re plotting. 

00:16:14.336 --> 00:16:25.992
If there are serious issues that go to your security that are motivating what we’re seeing, we can talk about them. 

00:16:25.992 --> 00:16:30.552
We have our own issues with things that you’re doing more broadly that are threatening to our security 

00:16:30.552 --> 00:16:37.696
or to European security, and we are willing to work, through diplomacy and dialogue, to see if we can resolve those. 

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:45.815
But if you reject diplomacy, if you reject dialogue, and if you go ahead with what we’re seeing, you need to 

00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:53.672
understand the costs and consequences to Russia will be severe, and you need to know that I mean what I say.”

00:16:53.672 --> 00:16:58.193
 In those communications with Russia, are they saying, “We’re serious about this”? 

00:16:58.193 --> 00:17:02.505
Because publicly there’s a, “We’re doing training exercises; we’re not planning an invasion.” 

00:17:02.505 --> 00:17:06.358
Are they communicating, “There’s things we want; we’re very serious about this”? 

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.744
 They’re denying. 

00:17:07.744 --> 00:17:13.632
They’re denying any imminent aggression against Ukraine. 

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:20.812
They’re saying that that’s not what we’re doing, not what we’re planning, but we do have real concerns 

00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:33.112
about our security, and we do see, allegedly, threats or challenges posed by you, by other countries, by NATO. 

00:17:33.112 --> 00:17:38.912
And our response is, the president’s response is, we have our own concerns, 

00:17:38.912 --> 00:17:45.920
but the thing to do then is to talk about them, to engage in diplomacy, to engage in dialogue. 

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.301
And in fact, that’s what happened. 

00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:54.091
We started a direct conversation with Russia over their claimed concerns. 

00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:57.968
We had a dialogue between NATO and Russia. 

00:17:57.968 --> 00:17:59.911
And this organization called the OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe], 

00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:03.112
which brings basically all of the countries of Europe together, including Ukraine, 

00:18:03.112 --> 00:18:08.000
initiated a similar dialogue with the Russians to test the proposition. 

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.306
Was this genuinely about security concerns that Russia said it had, 

00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:19.600
or was that simply a smokescreen as it prepared for the aggression, and it was going to move forward irrespective?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.816
 Based on the intelligence you had, did you think they were lying to you? 

00:18:23.816 --> 00:18:25.657
 Oh, yes. 

00:18:25.657 --> 00:18:27.637
Well, look, there’s a long history of this. 

00:18:27.637 --> 00:18:33.737
Any of us who had been through the experience of Russia’s aggression in 2014 against Ukraine, the initial invasion 

00:18:33.737 --> 00:18:39.704
in which they seized Crimea and went forward with their annexation, they seized a part of eastern Ukraine, 

00:18:39.704 --> 00:18:48.560
throughout that entire process, Russia, Putin had a clearly adversarial relationship with the truth. 

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.460
And they would say things, he would say things 

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:59.688
in conversations with President Obama, with Chancellor [Angela] Merkel and others at the time that were flat-out lies, 

00:18:59.688 --> 00:19:02.688
which we knew, and he would deny things that we could see.

00:19:02.688 --> 00:19:11.304
So the going-in proposition is that you’re unlikely to get the clean, clear truth. 

00:19:11.304 --> 00:19:17.136
But because we had such extraordinary visibility and extraordinary information, 

00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:24.336
we knew in real time when Putin was saying something that was in contradiction with what was actually happening.

00:19:24.336 --> 00:19:27.457
 I understand that you’re also communicating with President Zelenskyy 

00:19:27.457 --> 00:19:30.256
and trying to warn Ukraine about what your intelligence [is]. 

00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:36.436
What does a conversation like that—what is it like to tell a president that his country is imminently in danger?

00:19:36.436 --> 00:19:37.776
 Well, a few things were going on. 

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:43.128
We had this information in the early fall, and President Biden thought it was essential to, 

00:19:43.128 --> 00:19:49.176
in the first instance, share it with core allies and partners as well as with the Ukrainians. 

00:19:49.176 --> 00:19:57.368
And first there was an extraordinary meeting in Rome in October of that year. 

00:19:57.368 --> 00:20:03.455
The president brought together the French president, [Emmanuel] Macron, the then-British prime minister, 

00:20:03.455 --> 00:20:06.523
Boris Johnson, and Chancellor Merkel of Germany, 

00:20:06.523 --> 00:20:11.168
who was outgoing and brought along with her the incoming chancellor, Olaf Scholz. 

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:23.936
And we were in a small room on the margins of this G-7 meeting in Rome, with a handful of us in there. 

00:20:23.936 --> 00:20:26.736
I was there with President Biden, with the national security advisor Jake Sullivan, 

00:20:26.736 --> 00:20:35.328
and we laid out for our colleagues what we were seeing, what we had picked up. 

00:20:35.328 --> 00:20:38.840
And this was a big eye-opener. 

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:45.744
And it galvanized work among initially those four countries—France, the U.K., Germany and the United States—

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:51.404
both to try to make sure we were making every effort to prevent this, 

00:20:51.404 --> 00:20:56.280
but also making every effort to prepare for it if Russia went ahead nonetheless.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:03.392
A few days later, we were in Glasgow for the COP [Conference of the Parties], the climate summit, 

00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:11.272
and it was at that point that I shared with President Zelenskyy the same information, sitting in chairs, 

00:21:11.272 --> 00:21:15.424
just the two of us in a small room, just a couple feet from each other. 

00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.162
And it is a pretty sobering thing to share with a leader, with the president of another country, 

00:21:20.162 --> 00:21:24.792
our deep concern that his country may be on the brink of being invaded.

00:21:24.792 --> 00:21:28.104
 You rallied the allies—this is in the run-up to the invasion. 

00:21:28.104 --> 00:21:34.395
You warn Russia, and yet at the end of February, he orders the invasion. 

00:21:34.395 --> 00:21:38.353
He goes and gives a speech, very similar to the one in September, 

00:21:38.353 --> 00:21:41.384
where he talks about the West and the United States. 

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:46.110
At that point, as you’re watching the invasion, do you feel like there was something you could have done 

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:52.032
to prevent what happened, or was this a decision that you weren’t going to have been able to prevent?

00:21:52.032 --> 00:21:55.985
&nbsp; Well, ultimately I think this was a decision that Putin had basically made 

00:21:55.985 --> 00:21:59.792
and we were very unlikely to actually be able to stop. 

00:21:59.792 --> 00:22:06.252
But it was absolutely essential that we try everything possible to stop it, to prevent it. 

00:22:06.252 --> 00:22:11.764
That’s why we engaged so seriously in the diplomacy, in the dialogue. 

00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:18.741
We had to test the proposition that maybe there was a way to get him off of this course, 

00:22:18.741 --> 00:22:22.088
because we didn’t want this war. 

00:22:22.088 --> 00:22:23.108
No one wanted the war. 

00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:25.120
The Ukrainians didn’t want the war. 

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.936
Countries in Europe didn’t want the war. 

00:22:26.936 --> 00:22:32.826
No one around the world wanted the war, especially as they’re feeling the consequences of the Russian aggression. 

00:22:32.826 --> 00:22:35.384
The only person who wanted it was Vladimir Putin.

00:22:35.384 --> 00:22:44.064
And we had to find out if the rising storm was genuinely because there was some security concern 

00:22:44.064 --> 00:22:50.916
that Russia had that could be addressed in a way that also addressed our own interests and our own concerns, 

00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:55.576
or whether this was an inexorable path to war and that’s where Putin was going.

00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:57.944
And we tested that proposition. 

00:22:57.944 --> 00:23:03.984
We engaged intensely with the Russians directly, with NATO, with the OSCE. 

00:23:03.984 --> 00:23:08.200
Others did, too, all in coordination, very close coordination. 

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.040
And I had a moment with Lavrov, the foreign minister. 

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:18.912
We were meeting in January, so just a few weeks before the invasion, and after our meeting with our teams, 

00:23:18.912 --> 00:23:26.744
I pulled him aside and said to him, “Look, you need to tell us what is going on. 

00:23:26.744 --> 00:23:36.804
Is this really about your practical security concerns, or is this about the theological, the view that Ukraine is not its own 

00:23:36.804 --> 00:23:44.914
country and that your president is determined to erase its independence, erase its identity and subsume it into Russia? 

00:23:44.914 --> 00:23:49.395
If it’s the former, we need to keep on with the diplomacy; we need to keep on with the dialogue, 

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:55.335
because there are ways that we can address this together and address the many concerns 

00:23:55.335 --> 00:23:59.690
that we have about Russia’s threats to security in Europe and beyond. 

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:08.040
But if it’s about the latter, if it’s about the theological, the philosophical, that Ukraine’s not its own country, 

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.104
then we have a fundamental problem, 

00:24:11.104 --> 00:24:17.830
and you need to know that you’re going to suffer severe consequences for anything that you do.”

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.655
We had worked very hard to bring other countries along with this, 

00:24:21.655 --> 00:24:25.640
not only in the diplomacy and in the dialogue, but also to prepare. 

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:32.079
And one of the big advantages that we had in this aggression, as opposed to 2014 

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:38.664
when Russia first went into Ukraine, is we had time because of all the information we had to actually build the response. 

00:24:38.664 --> 00:24:45.204
And as we got into the end of the year, and again we became more and more convinced 

00:24:45.204 --> 00:24:52.328
that this is where Russia was going, we were able not only to share that information with allies and partners, 

00:24:52.328 --> 00:24:57.663
but actually to build a response, to bring countries together and agree, in advance, 

00:24:57.663 --> 00:25:04.512
that if Russia went ahead with the aggression, we would support Ukraine in very material ways. 

00:25:04.512 --> 00:25:10.016
We would impose severe consequences and costs on Russia, and we would take the steps necessary 

00:25:10.016 --> 00:25:12.115
to harden our own defensive alliance, NATO, 

00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:17.452
in case the Russian aggression went beyond Ukraine and was aimed at any NATO country.

00:25:17.452 --> 00:25:18.872
And that’s exactly what we did. 

00:25:18.872 --> 00:25:25.499
And it was very important that in the last weeks of the year, coming together, for example, 

00:25:25.499 --> 00:25:30.968
with the G-7 countries, the leading economies, democratic economies in the world, 

00:25:30.968 --> 00:25:35.808
we were able to say, as a group, publicly, that if Russia went ahead with the aggression, 

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:41.272
there would be severe costs and consequences and unprecedented sanctions.

00:25:41.272 --> 00:25:47.200
And that language, which was really important for the clarity and showing unity of purpose, 

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.307
was picked up after we got agreement on it with the G-7 countries, 

00:25:51.307 --> 00:25:56.794
was picked up by NATO, was picked up by the European Union, was picked up by other countries. 

00:25:56.794 --> 00:26:02.894
We wanted to make it as clear as possible to Russia what it risked if it went ahead in the hopes 

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:08.056
that maybe this would deter them, but also, if that didn’t happen, if Russia went ahead nonetheless, 

00:26:08.056 --> 00:26:11.712
that we would be able to react, respond immediately. 

00:26:11.712 --> 00:26:13.064
And that’s exactly what we did.

00:26:13.064 --> 00:26:16.168
 When you asked Sergey Lavrov, how does he respond to that question?

00:26:16.168 --> 00:26:19.240
 He wouldn’t address it. 

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:25.032
He tried to deviate; he tried to dodge it. 

00:26:25.032 --> 00:26:27.732
But he wouldn’t address it. 

00:26:27.732 --> 00:26:36.126
And you know, we had another moment in—just very shortly before the invasion by Russia on Feb. 24 

00:26:36.126 --> 00:26:42.568
where we decided at the last minute to go to New York, to go to the United Nations Security Council 

00:26:42.568 --> 00:26:50.896
and to make one last attempt to bring to the world everything we saw coming. 

00:26:50.896 --> 00:26:53.624
And we did it in detail. 

00:26:53.624 --> 00:26:58.580
I was able to say to the Security Council: “Here’s what’s going to happen over the next couple weeks. 

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:05.920
Here are the things that Russia’s going to do to try to create justifications and excuses, false-flag operations. 

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.838
Here are the steps they’re going to take.” 

00:27:07.838 --> 00:27:12.064
We laid it out in detail in front of the United Nations Security Council.

00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:18.392
And then I was able to say to the Russian representative at the Security Council, “This is your opportunity. 

00:27:18.392 --> 00:27:26.422
This is your opportunity not to say, ‘We have no plans to,’ or, ‘We have no intention of invading Ukraine’; 

00:27:26.422 --> 00:27:30.784
this is your opportunity to tell the world you will not invade Ukraine.” 

00:27:30.784 --> 00:27:33.056
And he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, do it.

00:27:33.056 --> 00:27:38.976
 … Did your understanding of Vladimir Putin change, because the president’s rhetoric becomes very different? 

00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:42.176
He says he’s a war criminal and a murderous thug, I think. 

00:27:42.176 --> 00:27:44.836
Did your understanding of who you were up against change, 

00:27:44.836 --> 00:27:49.216
and how did it change the way that the administration responded to the invasion?

00:27:49.216 --> 00:27:54.576
 Well, I don’t think anything changed in our understanding of who we were up against in President Putin. 

00:27:54.576 --> 00:28:00.184
This was known to President Biden and to many of us for a long time. 

00:28:00.184 --> 00:28:07.536
I think what we saw play out was the Achilles’ heel of autocracies, 

00:28:07.536 --> 00:28:14.072
and that is that there is no one in an autocratic system who is either able or willing to speak truth to power, 

00:28:14.072 --> 00:28:22.720
because we knew that there were people around Putin who thought this was an incredibly dangerous course to follow, 

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.644
but they wouldn’t or couldn’t tell Putin.

00:28:26.644 --> 00:28:36.604
And the profound danger in such a system is that it’s the will and whims of one person that make all the difference. 

00:28:36.604 --> 00:28:41.124
And that again underscores why it was so important for President Biden to communicate directly with Putin, 

00:28:41.124 --> 00:28:43.404
as he did throughout. 

00:28:43.404 --> 00:28:50.696
But it also is a constant challenge because it really is this one person.

00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:56.716
So—but I don’t think it changed anything in the sense that we knew what we were dealing with going in. 

00:28:56.716 --> 00:29:02.256
But what we were able to do immediately, because of all of the planning, the preparation, 

00:29:02.256 --> 00:29:06.800
the work that we did to bring countries around the world together on this was, 

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.944
as soon as the Russians pushed the button on the invasion, we acted. 

00:29:12.944 --> 00:29:20.604
We acted in defense of Ukraine with a massive effort to get into the hands of Ukrainians the weapons 

00:29:20.604 --> 00:29:21.977
that they needed to defend themselves. 

00:29:21.977 --> 00:29:28.671
In fact, that was an effort that began well before the aggression, to make sure that Ukrainians were prepared.

00:29:28.671 --> 00:29:34.429
If you go back to Labor Day, to September of 2021, the president did an initial what we call drawdown 

00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:41.444
of U.S. defense equipment to give to the Ukrainians, and then he did another very significant one just before Christmas. 

00:29:41.444 --> 00:29:43.664
So this is months before the invasion. 

00:29:43.664 --> 00:29:47.757
The result of that was that when the Russians came in and went at Kyiv, 

00:29:47.757 --> 00:29:54.077
the Ukrainians already had in their hands the very tools that they needed to fend off this Russian aggression: 

00:29:54.077 --> 00:29:59.304
the Javelins, the Stingers, the anti-tank, the anti-air systems that they were so effective in using. 

00:29:59.304 --> 00:30:05.670
First and foremost, it was their courage, their determination, but the fact that we, again, had helped them prepare 

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:09.350
made a huge difference in making sure that Russia could not take over the country, 

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:14.089
and indeed they got pushed out of Kyiv and pushed back to the east. 

00:30:14.089 --> 00:30:19.629
But then this machinery kicked with in with allies and partners who were also providing support to Ukraine, 

00:30:19.629 --> 00:30:26.205
but also the most consequential sanctions and export controls that have ever been deployed 

00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:33.445
that are having costs on Russia that were both immediate, but also are building and building and building over time. 

00:30:33.445 --> 00:30:36.728
The longer this goes on, the heavier those costs will be. 

00:30:36.728 --> 00:30:41.448
And it’s going to make it very, very hard for Russia to modernize its defense sector, 

00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:47.180
to modernize its energy extraction sector, to modernize its country. 

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.765
This is the path that Putin has taken the Russians down. 

00:30:51.765 --> 00:30:57.425
But that path is a path that we helped define by the work that was done 

00:30:57.425 --> 00:31:01.183
before the Russian aggression and then was actually carried out once they went in.

00:31:01.183 --> 00:31:05.223
 This man that you’ve defined who’s in charge of the country, who’s the one you’re dealing with, 

00:31:05.223 --> 00:31:10.849
who is willing to double down in a losing situation, whose troops have committed war crimes, 

00:31:10.849 --> 00:31:16.237
indiscriminate firing at civilian infrastructure, threating nuclear, all of this, 

00:31:16.237 --> 00:31:24.324
is Vladimir Putin somebody who you can work with, who can resolve this conflict in Ukraine?

00:31:24.324 --> 00:31:34.192
 Fundamentally, this is going to be up to Putin and what he decides. 

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:42.553
And all that we can do is make sure that we are doing everything possible to shape the environment 

00:31:42.553 --> 00:31:49.079
in which he’s making those decisions through our support to Ukraine, through our pressure on Russia, 

00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:55.756
through our efforts to bolster our own alliance, through the work that we’re doing to bring the world around, 

00:31:55.756 --> 00:31:59.716
through the work that we’re doing to deal with the second- and third-order effects of the Russian aggression, 

00:31:59.716 --> 00:32:03.536
for example, on rising food prices that people are feeling around the world,

00:32:03.536 --> 00:32:06.544
 rising energy prices that people are feeling around the world.

00:32:06.544 --> 00:32:10.544
That’s what we can do most effectively. 

00:32:10.544 --> 00:32:15.284
It’s what we’ve done to date very effectively. 

00:32:15.284 --> 00:32:21.546
But ultimately, we can’t decide President Putin’s policies for him. 

00:32:21.546 --> 00:32:24.352
We can’t decide what he will do or what he won’t do. 

00:32:24.352 --> 00:32:31.449
What we can do is have a profound effect on how he calculates the costs and consequences of his actions.
