00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.302
&gt;&gt; Rethinking&lt;i&gt; how&lt;/i&gt; we think,

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:04.504
this week on "Firing Line."

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.706
&gt;&gt; Being original is not easy,

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.608
but I have no doubt about this.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.976
It's the best way to improve

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.376
the world around us.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:13.413
&gt;&gt; He's a best-selling author

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.382
and organizational psychologist

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.284
whose big ideas reach millions.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.552
Adam Grant is an expert

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.254
on how we think and why.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.789
&gt;&gt; How do the motives that

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.823
we bring to our interactions

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.458
with other people shape

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.693
the results we achieve?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.194
&gt;&gt; A Wharton professor who's

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.163
advised Fortune 500 companies...

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.631
&gt;&gt; Sheryl Sandberg.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.499
&gt;&gt; Adam Grant.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.500
&gt;&gt; ...sports teams,

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.568
the Pentagon, and royalty.

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:36.870
&gt;&gt; Your body can't function

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:37.737
without your mind.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:38.738
&gt;&gt; His mantra --

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.440
we all need to open up our minds

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.108
and allow ourselves to rethink

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.877
our core beliefs -- about

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.379
business, politics,

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.181
even life itself.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.482
As the world changes faster

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.750
than ever before,

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.118
and our political culture

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.287
too often emphasizes digging in

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.122
over seeking common ground...

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.624
&gt;&gt; Jesus loves you!

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.958
&gt;&gt; My body, my choice!

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.527
&gt;&gt; ...what does Adam Grant

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.795
say now?

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.796
&gt;&gt; "Firing Line

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.030
with Margaret Hoover"

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:06.065
is made possible in part by...

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.909
And by...

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.714
Corporate funding is provided

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.750
by...

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.453
&gt;&gt; Adam Grant,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.720
welcome to "Firing Line."

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.387
&gt;&gt; Delighted to be here.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:31.191
&gt;&gt; You wrote the most-read

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:31.758
article on

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.059
&lt;i&gt;The New York Times'&lt;/i&gt; website

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.562
in 2021, in the midst of the

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.397
COVID-19 pandemic.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.766
And the title, "There's a Name

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.267
for That Blah You're Feeling.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.102
It's Called Languishing."

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.871
You argued that Americans

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.306
were collectively feeling

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.308
a sense of languishing,

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.578
and that sensation of stagnation

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.581
and emptiness could be helped by

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.516
just naming it.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.719
Now that we're in July of 2022,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.488
the pandemic is ongoing,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.756
inflation is high,

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.325
gas prices are high,

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.126
political polarization

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.828
continues.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.231
Are Americans still languishing?

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:11.831
Or would you call it

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:12.665
something else?

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:13.533
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's an interesting

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.200
question.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.002
I think -- I think a lot of

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.504
people are still languishing, in

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.304
part because of the

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.739
circumstances you're describing,

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:20.707
but also in part because

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.242
languishing is a feature

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.841
of the human condition.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.311
We used to call it ennui --

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:26.980
that sense of aimlessness

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.147
and joylessness,

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.315
where you feel like the world

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.483
around you is stagnating

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.251
and you're not able

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.552
to make any progress.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.286
And I think a lot of people

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.954
are feeling that right now.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.256
I don't think it's quite as

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.090
severe now,

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.224
from the data that I've seen.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.325
We're starting to see

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.159
a little bit of the tip,

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.661
from my perspective, of what's

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.329
called post-traumatic growth,

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:44.230
which is the idea

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.665
of not just bouncing back

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.066
but bouncing forward,

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.334
where people say,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.602
"I wish that hadn't happened,

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.904
but because I'm stuck with it,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.006
I'm going to walk away stronger,

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.274
I'm going to be more grateful,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.008
I'm going to have deeper

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.309
relationships with people,

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.043
and I'm going to have

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.044
a new sense of possibility

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.012
and purpose.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:02:59.712
&gt;&gt; You've talked about

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.347
the importance of flow

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:04.017
and that when you're in flow,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.818
you are entirely consumed

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.453
in a single activity

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.155
and that can help one break free

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.957
of languishing.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.159
You did this during the pandemic

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.160
by playing the video game

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.595
"Mario Kart" with your family

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.262
that was dispersed

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.064
across the country.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.065
How are you finding

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.533
your flow now?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.701
&gt;&gt; Well, "Mario Kart" is alive

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:22.669
and well.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.670
We actually just played.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.604
&gt;&gt; Do you do it as much as you

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.405
did during the pandemic?

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.439
&gt;&gt; Not quite,

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.541
but I think that some people

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.742
took that too literally, right?

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.644
So, I talked about --

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.146
&gt;&gt; You weren't advocating video

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:33.846
games as --

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.181
&gt;&gt; "Mario Kart" is the cure

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.349
for languishing, right?

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:37.317
The question is, what's

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.585
your version of "Mario Kart"?

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.986
And what I love about

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.688
"Mario Kart" is, it gives me

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.356
a sense of mastery.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.191
There is nothing like the joy

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.693
that I get out of,

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.361
you know, placing a banana peel

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.395
so that my brother-in-law

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:50.763
will slip on it.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.799
It forces me to be mindful.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.033
And the weird thing was,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.102
it also felt like I mattered,

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.337
because during the pandemic,

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.138
my kids were sort of

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.274
looking for something to do.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.742
And I felt like I was able

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.943
to create something that

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.411
energized them and excited them.

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.346
&gt;&gt; You describe moments

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.080
that you refer to

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.449
as collective effervescence.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.483
Perhaps you achieved that

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.551
with your family in playing

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:12.151
"Mario Kart."

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:13.152
But you also talk about

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.221
how most of us lost a sense

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:16.623
of collective effervescence

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.957
during the pandemic.

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:21.027
Now, as we look back, you know,

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.729
we don't know how COVID,

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.030
and long COVID in particular, is

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.032
going to affect the human body.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.700
But what about how COVID

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.068
in particular will affect

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:30.803
the human psyche?

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.008
Will we bounce back, or will

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.176
this sort of linger in the way

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:38.645
long COVID does to the body?

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.579
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:40.647
a really important question,

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.081
and the data on this are

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.282
surprising to a lot of people.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.951
So, not only will we bounce

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.819
back, many people have already

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.121
bounced back.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:49.922
If you look at the mental-health

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:51.624
trends during the pandemic,

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.760
by the summer of 2020, there was

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:56.029
actually a substantial rebound.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.063
And I think that maybe the

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.698
untold story of the last year

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.800
is people got more generous.

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.168
Rates of volunteering,

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.469
helping strangers, and

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.505
giving to charity all went up.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.140
And that is the default in all

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.474
kinds of disaster and tragedy.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.208
Right?

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:11.044
The news likes to amplify

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.513
the horror and the pain,

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.947
but the reality is that

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.083
what most people do is

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.152
they reach out in times of need.

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:20.253
And I think that's a hopeful

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.154
story about the human

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.954
condition -- right? --

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.322
that when people are depending

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.791
on you, you often find strength

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.259
you didn't know you had.

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:27.460
And that's something we need

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:28.094
to write about.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.595
That's something we need to

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.230
mark, because otherwise we don't

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.166
notice that it's happening.

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.200
&gt;&gt; As an organizational

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.301
psychologist,

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:36.369
you've consulted for some of

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.804
the world's top companies --

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.871
Google -- some of the world's

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:42.008
top institutions -- NASA.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.142
And I've heard you say

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.577
that hybrid work is

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.644
the global experiment of 2022.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:48.314
&gt;&gt; Well, I think hybrid is the

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.550
future and maybe even the

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:51.517
present, too.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.853
We saw many companies commit

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.288
to return-to-office plans

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:56.823
and then abandon them because

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.524
people didn't want to do it

00:05:58.591 --> 00:05:59.625
but also because the evidence

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.494
is strong that as long as people

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.395
are in the office together

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.130
about half the week, on average,

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:04.997
if you let them work from

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.599
anywhere the rest of the week,

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.800
they are more productive, more

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.702
satisfied, more likely to stay,

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.970
no cost to their

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.438
promotion opportunities,

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.473
their collaboration,

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.174
or their relationships.

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.275
And I think a lot of leaders

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:17.310
have been dragged kicking

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.145
and screaming into this, saying,

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.314
"But how do I micromanage you

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.513
if I'm not sitting next to you?"

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.818
And forgetting that, in fact,

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.086
if they want to earn trust,

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.054
the best way to do that

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.622
is to show trust.

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:30.723
If you give people a little bit

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.158
of freedom and flexibility,

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.392
they reciprocate that with

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.428
loyalty and commitment.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.462
There are challenges with

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:37.697
hybrid work.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:39.165
It's harder, for example,

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.333
to do informal learning

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.135
and mentoring when we

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.269
we don't walk out of a meeting

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.637
and debrief it.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:45.705
The meeting just ends, and we

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:46.773
disappear if we're in a Zoom

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.907
call.

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:48.674
It's a little bit harder

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.642
to feel a sense of culture

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:50.643
when you're not in the same room

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.577
with people.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.012
But that doesn't mean we need

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.380
to be sitting next to each other

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.115
every day of the week.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:56.682
&gt;&gt; Last year in

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:57.817
the United States,

00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:58.851
47 million people

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.119
quit their jobs.

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.254
This is referred to as

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.722
the Great Resignation.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.190
With the economy now approaching

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.758
a slowdown, established

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:07.059
companies and startups making

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:09.595
cuts in the workforce,

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.631
the so-called Great Resignation

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:13.432
may be over.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.034
But have the fundamental issues

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.969
that caused so many employees

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:19.739
to quit been resolved?

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.440
&gt;&gt; I know of four factors

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:22.775
that seem to be driving

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.710
those decisions to walk away.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.379
One is being underpaid

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:27.613
and finally throwing your hands

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.347
up and saying,

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.316
"I can't take it anymore."

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.952
Two is probably a taste

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.821
of freedom, that people

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.155
got a sense of flexibility

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.623
when they didn't have a boss

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.457
breathing down their neck

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:39.926
anymore, and they wanted

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.060
more of it.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.662
Then a third factor

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.163
seems to be burnout,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.298
that, you know, a lot of people

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.233
were just exhausted.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.801
And then, four, what's causing

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.336
that burnout more than anything

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.337
else, it seems to be toxic

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:52.238
culture.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.239
There was a great study

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.340
published earlier this year

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.274
looking at the drivers

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.075
of turnover.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.743
Toxic culture was 10 times more

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.712
important than anything else

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:00.847
in predicting whether

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:01.714
people were going to leave

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.482
or stay in their jobs.

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:04.750
And I don't think those factors

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:06.118
are changing -- right? -- as we

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.753
move into an economic slowdown.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.288
We still see people underpaid.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.523
We still see people

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.991
wanting more flexibility.

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.826
We still see people burning out.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:14.994
And toxic cultures

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.029
are sadly alive and well.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:17.864
And I think people are going

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.098
to keep jumping ship

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.933
until we really rethink

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.269
what it means to be a workplace

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.036
and try to build

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.071
a real community where people

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.372
can do meaningful work

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.641
and feel trusted and respected

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.443
by the people around them.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:31.577
&gt;&gt; You know, it reminds me of

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.179
the work-life balance research

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:35.014
you've conducted.

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.682
Has the pandemic changed

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:38.484
Americans' priorities,

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:39.819
in terms of how much of

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:40.820
themselves they're willing

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:42.221
to dedicate to a job?

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:43.356
&gt;&gt; I would love to see

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.156
better data on this.

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:45.091
It's such a good question.

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.125
I think, anecdotally,

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.326
from what I've seen,

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:48.661
more people have

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.263
walked home from work one day,

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:52.031
by which I mean, you know,

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.799
walk from their home office

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:54.800
to their kitchen,

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.435
which might be the same place,

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.738
and said, "I don't want my life

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.806
to be defined by work.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.575
Why do I arrange my whole life

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.476
around work?

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:04.610
What if I could figure out

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.212
what my life priorities are

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.347
and then fit my job into that?"

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.615
And I think there's been a --

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:10.549
there's been a really

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:11.717
interesting anti-ambition

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:13.719
movement -- right? -- during the

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:14.453
pandemic.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.454
&gt;&gt; Tell me more.

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:16.856
&gt;&gt; I've seen a growing number of

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:17.957
our students at Wharton,

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.191
I've also just heard from a

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:20.326
number of -- I guess

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.761
a growing number of my

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.296
"WorkLife" podcast listeners

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.197
saying, "Why do we have to

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.033
worship at the altar of hustle?

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.567
Why do we pray to a high priest

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:29.835
of grit?

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:32.471
Shouldn't we think about what

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.407
matters to us in life

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:35.808
and then try to figure out,

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:37.576
'Okay. Well, how can my work

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:38.744
support that?'"

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:39.745
And I've also seen

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:40.713
a lot of leaders and managers

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.448
sort of wake up and realize,

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:43.149
"You know what?

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:44.383
If people don't have quality of

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.584
life, I'm not going

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:46.719
to get quality work."

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.321
And if there is a silver lining

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:50.957
of COVID for our jobs,

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.658
it's that, for the first time

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:53.859
in my two decades as

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.661
an organizational psychologist,

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:56.696
we have many leaders

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.030
and managers realizing that

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.966
mental health is part of health.

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:01.867
I love an example of a manager

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.235
who said to a team,

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:04.570
"Look, it's okay to call in

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.204
sick.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.473
It's also okay to call in sad."

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.541
And, Margaret, what I loved

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:09.575
about that was not the idea

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:10.609
that, "Now we're going to give

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:11.777
you five sad days a year, and if

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:12.912
you don't use them by December,

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:14.013
we're gonna take them away,"

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.513
right?

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.382
It was the idea of normalizing

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.184
the fact that it's okay to take

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.419
some time to try to recharge.

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:23.589
&gt;&gt; Gwyneth Paltrow, JJ Abrams,

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:24.457
former "Firing Line"

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:25.391
guest Melinda Gates

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.726
and Sheryl Sandberg

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:29.528
have all come to you for advice.

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:31.464
Even Prince Harry, you told him,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.766
"I cannot overstate

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:34.900
the importance of a leader

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.535
and a manager saying, 'I care

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.704
more about your well-being

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.373
than I do about your results.'"

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:41.707
So you're saying

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:42.708
caring about employees

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.310
is good for the bottom line.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.478
&gt;&gt; In the long run.

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:46.879
Yeah, I think a lot of leaders

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.347
see it as a cost, right?

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.415
Or as a distraction.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.951
In the short term, maybe it is.

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:54.620
In the long run, people

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.222
generally will not care about

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.857
your mission unless you care

00:10:57.923 --> 00:10:59.892
about them, full stop.

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:01.127
&gt;&gt; Is that generational?

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:02.661
Because these are not

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:04.230
characteristics that define

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.098
Gen X or the baby boomer

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.299
generation.

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:08.234
So how much of this

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.568
is generational and how much

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:12.138
of this is the new normal

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:13.406
based on the circumstances

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.474
created by a new economy

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:16.541
and COVID?

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.110
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty skeptical

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:18.844
of claims

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:20.646
that generations differ

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.415
in their fundamental values.

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.116
I think that human values

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:27.953
are part of our psyche,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.155
and they don't seem to just

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:29.855
radically shift

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:32.055
from one generation to the next.

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:33.492
There was -- there's actually --

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:34.293
I think a lot of the claims

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.394
that we make about generational

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.029
differences are stereotypes.

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.164
Right? They're generalizations

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.132
about an entire group of people

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:41.167
that happen to be born in the

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:42.835
same roughly 20-year window

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:43.869
and assuming they have a bunch

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:44.970
of common characteristics.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:45.771
&gt;&gt; So then what changes?

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:46.939
Cultural values change?

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.040
&gt;&gt; Well, I think what changes

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:49.742
is people's expectations

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.143
and the way that they express

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.244
their values.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:54.647
And so I think that we should be

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.248
really careful when we assume

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:57.650
that this premium

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.251
on caring about people

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:01.020
is a millennial goal.

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.221
I think what's changed is

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:02.888
that millennials

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:03.823
are more self-expressive

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:04.890
than other generations, right?

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:05.624
&gt;&gt; That's for sure.

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:06.725
&gt;&gt; So they're a lot more likely

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:07.259
to tell you.

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:08.060
And they also have the

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:08.894
communication tools to

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:10.129
make it very, very apparent

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:10.863
when they are not

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:11.931
getting what they want.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:12.932
And that's true of Gen Z,

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:13.998
as well.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.301
And so I don't think it's

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:16.969
a generational shift so much

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.471
as I think it's a -- it's a set

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:19.738
of expectations that have

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:22.141
changed and a set of tools

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:22.908
and technologies

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:24.176
that have made it possible

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:25.411
to voice those expectations

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.011
and actually get heard.

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:30.282
&gt;&gt; Your best seller from 2021,

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:31.317
"Think Again: The Power

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:33.953
of Knowing What You Don't Know,"

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:36.655
helps make the case to readers

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.157
that the ability to rethink

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:39.592
one's own opinions

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:42.128
and assumptions is a critical

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.729
characteristic for success.

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.598
One of the places where this is

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:46.932
most difficult and least

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:50.503
acceptable is in our politics.

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:52.304
I want to give you an example.

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:54.073
Representative Adam Kinzinger,

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.508
a Republican from Illinois,

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.276
came to Congress in 2011,

00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:58.177
completely opposed

00:12:58.244 --> 00:12:59.445
any kind of gun reform or gun

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.380
reform legislation.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.448
He still calls himself

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:03.115
a defender

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:04.016
of the Second Amendment,

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.719
but just last month, he signed

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.954
on to the first bipartisan

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:10.589
federal gun legislation in 30 --

00:13:10.656 --> 00:13:13.359
almost 30 years.

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.027
He re-evaluated his thinking

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:16.695
after mass shootings in El Paso

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.097
and Dayton.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.832
And you and I both know

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.501
that it is almost impossible

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:23.369
for elected officials

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:24.603
to change their mind without

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.372
being called flip-floppers

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:29.275
or without really being attacked

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.609
for being seen as weak.

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:31.911
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.212
&gt;&gt; How can we make it more

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.914
politically tenable

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.282
for political leaders

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:37.616
to re-examine their thinking

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:38.751
in the face of new evidence

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.019
and circumstances?

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:40.886
&gt;&gt; That is such

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:41.954
an important question.

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:43.055
It might be the defining

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.390
question of our time.

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:46.392
And I think the starting point

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:47.660
for me is to recognize

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.228
that changing your mind

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:50.029
doesn't necessarily

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:51.397
make you a hypocrite.

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:52.264
It might mean

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.331
that you've learned something.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.700
And the question is,

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.035
why are you changing your mind?

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.069
It's not whether you've changed

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.003
your mind, right?

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.871
It's why.

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.072
If you're changing your mind

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.074
because you're trying to cater

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.677
to your constituents, then I

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:05.811
think it's reasonable to ask,

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.878
"Is this person flip-flopping?

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:08.514
Do they have real integrity?"

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:09.348
&gt;&gt; Flip-flopping is

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.983
an opportunistic change of mind.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.784
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.219
Where you're basically

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:14.353
abandoning your principles,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.321
and now I have questions

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:17.089
about your moral character.

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.157
But learning

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.258
is when you change your mind

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:20.859
because you encounter better

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.895
logic or stronger evidence.

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.029
And if you don't change

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:25.097
your mind in the face

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.565
of new facts,

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.100
then you are basically closing

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.501
the door to evolving.

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:30.769
And last time I checked,

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:31.937
learning is not about affirming

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:32.871
what you already believe.

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:33.939
It's about evolving

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:34.840
what you believe.

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:35.841
This is what I would ask --

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:37.009
This is exactly what I would ask

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.277
politicians to do is,

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.345
I would ask them,

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.379
"What are your current

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:41.380
principles, and what are the

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:42.448
conditions that would change

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:43.482
your mind?"

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.484
And if they pre-commit to

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.219
the evidence and the information

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:49.054
that would lead them to shift,

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:50.589
then all of a sudden,

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:51.724
when they evolve according

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.025
to that information,

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.093
when the world changes,

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.227
they change with it,

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:56.962
now I know they're learning and

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.097
they're not being hypocrites,

00:14:58.163 --> 00:14:58.864
and I don't think we spend

00:14:58.931 --> 00:14:59.632
enough time

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.166
asking politicians to explain,

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:01.967
"Okay, look,

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:02.968
I know you're a supporter

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:04.203
of the Second Amendment,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.271
and I know right now

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.472
what that means is you're trying

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:07.906
to protect the right to bear

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.608
arms in a variety of ways.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:10.976
What kinds of events in America

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:12.511
would have to happen to lead you

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:13.679
to wonder if we're taking

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.214
that freedom too far

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:16.448
and if there aren't ways

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:17.750
to give people that freedom

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:19.718
and still protect them

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.320
from mass shootings?"

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:22.988
Maybe we could even fulfill

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:23.756
both of those values

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:25.591
at the same time. Maybe.

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:27.159
&gt;&gt; I mean, as you know,

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.427
there are many people in our

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.828
politics who would pridefully

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:32.331
say, "There are no circumstances

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:33.732
or conditions under which my

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.301
mind would be changed,"

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:36.969
and they would be rewarded

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:37.936
by their voters

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:40.072
for taking that position.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.473
&gt;&gt; Do you really think that?

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.474
&gt;&gt; In the base of the

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:43.676
Republican Party? Absolutely.

00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:45.010
&gt;&gt; I'm not so sure.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:45.844
&gt;&gt; Tell me why.

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:47.046
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that there's --

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.280
First of all, there's a risk

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.248
that some of these candidates

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.449
end up looking completely

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.151
stubborn and inflexible.

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:53.285
And nobody wants to be led

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:55.187
by a politician who refuses

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:57.489
to ever learn.

00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:59.091
Now, the question is, are there

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.592
some single-issue voters

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:03.195
or maybe sacred issues

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:04.997
where people are okay with that?

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:05.864
Sure.

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:08.467
So maybe we don't start on guns.

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.335
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:10.636
So then let's take this approach

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.771
to my skepticism,

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:14.440
because, as you know,

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:15.908
many Republicans

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:17.242
still believe that Donald Trump

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.777
won the election,

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:20.846
and they believe

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:22.748
in Donald Trump's election lie,

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:23.682
that Joe Biden is an

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:25.351
illegitimate president.

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:26.385
If you are face-to-face

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:27.820
with an election denier,

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:29.121
how would you make

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:30.823
a persuasive argument?

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:31.623
&gt;&gt; This is really hard.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.491
I don't know if you can make

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:33.359
a persuasive argument.

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:34.526
&gt;&gt; Because there are some people

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:36.795
who simply won't engage with the

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:38.230
possibility that they're wrong.

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:38.997
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:39.765
So the first thing I would do

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:40.866
is, I would get out of preacher

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.034
and prosecutor mode.

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.834
"I'm right, you're wrong."

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:45.571
The harder I work to proselytize

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.840
my views and attack yours,

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:48.774
the more likely you are

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.242
to disengage altogether.

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.909
Or when I show up

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.077
in prosecutor mode,

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.245
you bring your defense attorney

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.314
to court and then neither of us

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.714
is willing to budge.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:58.584
What I would do is I would sit

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.419
down with that person and say,

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:03.088
"It sounds like you are really

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.057
convinced that Donald Trump

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.258
won the election.

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.059
What evidence

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:09.128
would change your mind on that?"

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.362
And if you say, "Nothing,"

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:11.864
which I've had happen, I say,

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.965
"Okay. I just wanted to be

00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:13.966
clear -- this is a religion for

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:14.733
you.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.235
This is an article of faith

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:17.336
that you take as seriously

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.437
as your faith in God.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.072
No matter who you spoke to

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:22.107
or what information you saw,

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.375
you're not going to budge."

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:24.109
And most of the time,

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:25.043
people backpedal

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.979
when I say that, and they say,

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:28.046
"Well, no, of course,

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:29.248
if I were to see the following,

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.849
I would reconsider."

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:32.284
And that's -- that's then,

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:33.619
you know, a little bit of a foot

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:34.453
in the door, right?

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.454
You're not necessarily gonna

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:36.288
change their mind in that

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.456
conversation, but changing

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.191
people's deep-seated beliefs,

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.592
especially when

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:41.326
they're consistent

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:42.594
with their hopes and dreams,

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.897
is not an overnight project.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:45.531
Right? It's almost

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:46.765
a lifetime commitment.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:48.066
And so what I want to do

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.401
is, I actually don't want

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:50.035
to make an argument

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.069
in that conversation.

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:52.237
I just want to get them to

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:53.839
reflect on if there's anything

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.040
that would change their mind.

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:56.041
And guess what -- now they're

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:57.042
in the driver's seat.

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.177
They feel a sense of ownership

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.278
over their own beliefs.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:00.479
They're not under threat.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:01.246
They don't have to put up

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:02.514
a shield.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.649
&gt;&gt; Most folks that you talk

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:05.317
to will cite the things

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:06.218
that they've seen in the media

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:07.252
because they trust their trusted

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.188
media and media sources.

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:10.422
&gt;&gt; And that's the kicker here,

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:10.923
right?

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:12.124
When people believe things

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:13.058
that aren't true, when they're

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.060
drawn to conspiracy theories,

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:16.595
the problem is not one of

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.197
information, it's one of trust.

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:19.263
Right?

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.799
They are, generally speaking,

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.134
if you look at what draws people

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.936
to conspiracy theories,

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.405
they are looking to feel --

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:27.139
generally speaking,

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.140
people want to feel like

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.007
they have unique knowledge.

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.709
They want to feel that they're

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.077
in control in a world

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.979
that feels out of control.

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.614
And so it's much more comforting

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:36.849
to believe that there are

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.450
a few powerful people

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:40.352
that are orchestrating

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:41.854
the system for their own gain

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.355
than to believe, "You know what?

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:44.523
Like, sometimes the world is

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.191
unfair, and I'm the victim of

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:47.359
that."

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:49.328
&gt;&gt; You write about binary bias

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:50.496
and the human tendency

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:53.298
to seek clarity by simplifying

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.567
every issue into two categories.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.170
So adding complexity and nuance

00:18:58.237 --> 00:18:59.638
is actually a way out

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:02.174
of our hyper-polarization.

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:02.941
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:05.010
Binary bias is all around us,

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.278
and the more charged an issue

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.679
is, the more likely we are

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.315
to take a complex spectrum of

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:12.351
issues and beliefs and

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:13.952
oversimplify it by dumbing it

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.654
down into only two categories.

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:17.022
I love Robert Benchley's take

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.557
on this when he wrote

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:19.825
that "There are only two kinds

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.026
of people in the world -- those

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:22.127
who divide the world into two

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.262
kinds of people and those who

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:24.463
don't," right?

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.031
And too many of us are in that

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.000
first camp.

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.935
&gt;&gt; But take a hot-button issue

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.370
that's relevant in this moment.

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:32.004
Abortion.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.005
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.439
All right. So Tim Kundro and I

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.074
ran a series of experiments

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:37.276
where we started

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:38.577
with the premise that

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:39.945
what you're encouraged to do --

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:40.946
everyone did this after

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.314
Donald Trump was elected --

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:43.348
you know, listen to the other

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:45.617
side, take their perspective.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.652
And guess what.

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:47.986
On charged issues, when somebody

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.087
is on the other side

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.522
of a spectrum from you,

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.890
the more you try to take

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:52.991
your perspective,

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:54.459
the less likely you are

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.061
to see their perspective,

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.930
because you're just guessing,

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.498
and you do not want

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.099
to see the good in them.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:01.833
So how do we get people

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.101
to realize that?

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:04.503
One of the ways we get to that

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.138
is, we said,

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:09.274
"Can you reflect on your life

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:10.342
having followed a different

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:11.577
trajectory?

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:12.911
Imagine you were born

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:14.246
in a family that had

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.815
the opposite views on abortion.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:17.883
If you're a liberal, imagine you

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.052
were born in a religious family.

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:21.053
If you're conservative,

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:22.220
imagine you were born

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:23.522
on one of the coasts

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:25.123
to a bunch of atheists."

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.158
We asked people to do that

00:20:26.224 --> 00:20:27.759
for just a couple minutes

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.061
and then engage with somebody

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:30.462
from the opposite side,

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:31.496
and their approach

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:32.898
is radically different.

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.166
They go from complaining

00:20:34.232 --> 00:20:36.168
about baby killers

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:38.270
and women oppressors to saying,

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:39.938
"I don't agree with your stance

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:40.906
on the policy,

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:41.807
but I respect the fact

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:43.241
that you have a worthy principle

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:44.409
behind it,"

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:45.510
which is either, you know,

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:48.113
freedom or dignity of life.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.715
And I think that this idea

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:50.782
of counterfactual thinking,

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.017
imagine that I was born

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.352
in a different world

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:54.386
or to a different family

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:55.988
or in a different time.

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.089
What it forces you to do

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:58.290
is realize that my beliefs

00:20:58.357 --> 00:20:59.758
are not set in stone,

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.526
that it's possible I could have

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.161
a different stance on this issue

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:04.429
if I had experienced

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:05.897
a different set of life events.

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:07.232
And guess what -- now I realize

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:08.200
it's possible you could have

00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:09.434
gone through that, too,

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.569
and that makes me more open

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:11.937
to rethinking my views

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.773
and also maybe puts you

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.974
in a position where you're more

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.276
open to rethinking yours.

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.745
&gt;&gt; This program, "Firing Line,"

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:21.346
is a revival

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.481
of the original "Firing Line,"

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:24.049
which was hosted for 33 years

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.618
by William F. Buckley Jr.

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:27.386
One of the hallmarks

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:29.187
of his program is that Buckley

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:30.589
welcomed all points of view

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:31.223
from across

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:32.424
the political spectrum

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.359
and engaged with friends

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:36.728
from the opposite perspective.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:37.629
One of those friends

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:38.597
was Al Lowenstein,

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:39.898
who was a Democrat who was

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:40.932
admired by both liberals

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:41.833
and conservatives

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.235
and was a guest of Buckley's

00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:44.603
on this program many times.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.604
I want you to listen to this

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:47.539
excerpt from that program

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.606
in 1971.

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:50.108
&gt;&gt; First, I'll answer what I was

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:50.942
trying to answer before you

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:51.877
tried to get me to answer the

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:52.844
thing I'm not trying to answer.

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:53.812
Then I'll answer your second --

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:54.713
&gt;&gt; Which you will not answer.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.881
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll answer both in due

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:56.381
course.

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.883
What my feelings are,

00:21:57.949 --> 00:21:58.884
and I think you would agree

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.018
with this, is that people,

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.753
regardless of party labels,

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.821
ought to work together on issues

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:04.021
they agree about.

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:05.457
I don't think that my agreeing

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:06.291
with you about the draft

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:07.125
means that I'm committed

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:08.193
necessarily to supporting you

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.094
if you run for president.

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.262
If so, it'd be an awful decision

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:10.996
for me to make because

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:11.997
I'd like to work with you --

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:12.664
[ Laughter ]

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:13.732
I would like to continue working

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:14.700
with you against the draft

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:15.934
without feeling that obliged me

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:16.668
to support your ambitions.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.303
&gt;&gt; You're being very sly, Al.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.738
You're being very sly.

00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:20.972
&gt;&gt; I can't keep up with you in

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.908
the department of being sly.

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.676
&gt;&gt; Two men, opposing political

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:27.279
views, able to engage with each

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:31.450
other respectfully, humorously,

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.218
with goodwill, and with

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:35.520
a presumption of goodwill.

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:37.255
How do we get back to that?

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.657
&gt;&gt; Time machine?

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:39.725
You need a DeLorean or a

00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:41.993
Tesseract right now.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.595
I would love to return to that

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:45.063
era.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.130
What do we do?

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.699
So, people often say

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:49.334
great minds think alike.

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:50.736
Great minds don't think alike.

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:51.470
They challenge each other

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.238
to think again.

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:54.106
A lot of people think

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:55.440
that harmony is about

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.507
always being on the same page.

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:58.110
But if you actually think about

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:59.511
what musical harmony is,

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:00.679
it's the pleasing arrangement

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:02.514
of different tones.

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:04.249
And what that means is, when

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:05.984
somebody disagrees with you,

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:07.252
if you object to what

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:08.720
they think, you have a lot

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:10.756
to learn from how they think.

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:11.890
Now, of course, we would all

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:13.191
rather be surrounded by people

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:14.726
with similar values,

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:16.595
but similarity of values

00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:18.096
is not beneficial

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:19.731
unless you also have disparity

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:21.399
of views.

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:22.267
I think consensus

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:23.268
makes us comfortable.

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:24.102
It's actually dissent

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:25.403
that makes us smarter.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.304
And so when you encounter

00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:27.172
somebody

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.373
who doesn't share your politics,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.508
instead of immediately

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:30.142
retreating

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:31.109
into your echo chamber

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:32.477
or your filter bubble,

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:33.411
you could say,

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:35.480
"Wow. I actually learned more

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:37.082
from ideas that make me think

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:38.183
hard than opinions

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.484
that make me feel good.

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:40.619
I want to surround myself

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:41.419
with people who challenge

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:42.521
my thought process,

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:43.789
not the ones that agree

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:44.923
with my conclusions."

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.757
And I've actually started doing

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:47.125
this on social media.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.126
I realized most of the people

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:49.928
I followed where people I

00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:50.729
liked --

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:51.730
I basically was following people

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:52.664
because I liked the answers

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:53.965
they gave.

00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:55.333
And instead, I said,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.234
"What if I pay attention

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:57.702
to people because I admire

00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:59.037
the intellectual integrity

00:23:59.104 --> 00:23:59.738
they bring

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:00.872
to the questions they ask?"

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.439
In other words,

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:02.207
who are the people

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:03.341
I would listen to, regardless

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:04.743
of what conclusion they reached,

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.078
because I respect the discipline

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:08.280
and rigor of their thought

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:09.214
process?"

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.482
And paying attention to those

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:11.783
people, seeking those people out

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.652
for podcast conversations,

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:14.886
reading their articles,

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:15.554
has taught me

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.289
so much more than paying

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:18.423
attention to the people who hold

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.025
the same views that I do.

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:21.026
And I think what that requires

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:22.227
is to recognize that,

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.295
when people challenge

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:25.030
your core beliefs,

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:26.231
that is not a threat

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.065
to your ego.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.633
It's an opportunity to grow.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.235
&gt;&gt; I'm sure you've seen NASA's

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.103
James Webb Telescope images,

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.939
just mind-blowing images

00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:35.006
of deep space.

00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:36.842
And you've written about

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.176
the effect that astronauts,

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:40.312
by having the perspective

00:24:40.378 --> 00:24:41.913
of how small humankind is

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.983
as they are orbiting the Earth,

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.785
that reaction, known as

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.854
the Overview Effect, you say,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.488
makes astronauts realize

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.157
"a common identity

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:53.425
within all humankind."

00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:55.227
Do you think these new glimpses

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:56.228
of the unknown

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:58.063
and deep space might have

00:24:58.129 --> 00:24:59.598
a similar effect for all of us?

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.066
&gt;&gt; It's fascinating.

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.934
The studies on astronauts that

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.369
have captured this have shown

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:06.338
that they consistently come back

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:08.907
with more universalist values.

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:10.442
In other words, valuing

00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:12.978
all humans or even all life

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.412
and the planet that protects

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:15.814
human life in a way

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.382
that they didn't before.

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:18.483
I don't know that just looking

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.584
at a telescope image

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:20.819
can accomplish the same thing.

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:22.554
And so I think what we should do

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:24.222
is, we should take everybody

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.890
who holds hateful views...

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:25.891
&gt;&gt; And send them to space.

00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:27.359
&gt;&gt; ...we should slingshot them

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:28.260
out to space.

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:29.327
This is the best empirical

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:30.562
argument for space tourism

00:25:30.629 --> 00:25:31.696
that I've ever seen.

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.465
And see if that is a lasting

00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:35.500
shift in their worldview.

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:36.835
&gt;&gt; Adam Grant,

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:37.769
thank you for your work,

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:38.670
for your research,

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:39.704
for your contribution, and for

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:40.672
joining me here on

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:41.539
"Firing Line."

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:42.374
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.106
It's an honor to be here.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.677
